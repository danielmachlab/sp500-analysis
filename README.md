# sp500-analysis
Implement various single-regime and two-state Markov-Switching GARCH models to analyze the daily S&amp;P 500 Index (^GSPC) data from beginning of 1990 to April 15, 2020. Both in-sample and out-of-sample performances of the implemented models will be compared. The Markov-Switching GARCH model is one type of Regime-Switching models in finance.
